  <h1>About the U.L.B.C</h1>
  <h3 style="color:gray;">(The Unnecessarily Long <abbr title="Biography">Bio.</abbr> Club)</h3>
  <p>The U.L.B.C. is a very famous organization formerly led by our former all-powerful dictator for life—I mean boss—Ethan Johnson, who founded this Organization in January 2023. He was the only member for a month or two until Timothy Caudill joined in March 2023 as the Vice President. Eventualy Jude Krusemark, the secretary, and Bobby Cleveland, the treasurer, joined. After a few hours of chatting, the members took a vote to decide if <span style="color:rgb(255, 105, 180);">bright pink</span> would be the new official U.L.B.C. color. Everyone voted thumbs up<span style="display:none;" id="isfavcolor">, and now since you have joined, that is your new favorite color</span>. Many other people joined since then.</p>
  <h2>The Event/Incident</h2>
  <p>On August 21, 2023, Ethan Johnson, our Almighty Dictator for Life, stepped down to the humble role of Founder after entering a school with increased responsibilities. Although he does not have nearly as much power, he can still make underlying decisions due to his roots in the Organization. Timothy Caudill moved up to Almighty Dictator, as declared by the Founder, and Timothy chose Payton Wyatt to be the new Vice President. Boston Mendonça was demoted to the lousy role of servant, and Zoe Stevenson, a member before The Event, was assumed Video Editor.</p>
